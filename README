"Learning Processing" is a 2008 book that serves as a gentle introduction to 
the theory and practice of programming. It works by introducing code concepts 
over the course of 23 chapters, and creating a series of examples that build 
on them. The book was written by professor Daniel Shiffman of the ITP in 
New York City.

These samples have been ported over to Ruby-Processing, which can be found here:
